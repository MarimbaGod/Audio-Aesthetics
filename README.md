## Design

- [API design](docs/apidocsnonotes.md)
- [Database Model](docs/data-model-diagram.png)
- [Front-End Layout](docs/front-end-layout.md)
- [Third-Party Integrations](docs/thirdpartyinfo.md)

## Our Users

Our Users are people who value music, art, and connecting with others over shared artistic taste and experiences.

## Current Functionality

As a User, I can:

- Create an Account.
- Make Posts about the music I love.
- Like Posts by other Users who share things relevant to my musical interests.
- Follow other Users who share a similar Audio Aesthetic as me.
- Link my Spotify Account
- See my Playlists
- Search through Spotify
- Use Stable Diffusion's Dreambooth V4 Text to Image Endpoint to generate a text-based image of any song I select from any of my playlists.

## The Future of Audio Aesthetics

- Color-based "Audio Aesthetic" data curated from a User's Spotify history that is displayed on their profile and used to match them to other Users who share similar tastes.

- Public Groups where Users can share posts just among their group.
- Private Groups where Users can share posts privately only among other Users who are in the same group.
- Further Spotify Integration for Users to create and share their own playlists based on their Audio Aesthetic.
- Further Stable Diffusion integration to allow users to create images based on their Spotify history.

## How to run Audio Aesthetics locally:

1. Clone our repo.
2. CD into the root directory of the project.
3. RUN docker volume create postgres-data
4. RUN docker compose build
5. RUN docker compose up
6. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to see our Front-End and localhost:8000/docs to see the FastAPI Swagger UI.
